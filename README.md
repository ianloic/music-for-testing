# Music For Testing

This is a collection of a few Creative Commons licensed tracks that I use for
testing various audio analysis software that I'm developing. I found these on
the [Free Music Archive](https://freemusicarchive.org/).

I chose them because they're the kind of music that I want the tools I'm
developing to work well with, and I like them so I'm happy to listen to them
during development.
